# Anvyl CLI Issues Fixed

## Problem
The Anvyl CLI was experiencing issues with Typer 0.16.0 due to API changes. The main error was:
```
'Typer' object has no attribute 'group'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by breaking changes in Typer 0.16.0 where the `@app.group()` decorator was removed. In newer versions of Typer, command groups must be created using `app.add_typer()` with separate `typer.Typer()` instances.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Command Group Structure
**Before (Broken):**
```python
@app.group(name="host")
def host_commands():
    """Host management commands."""
    pass

@host_commands.command("list")
def list_hosts(...):
    # command implementation
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
host_app = typer.Typer(help="Host management commands.")
app.add_typer(host_app, name="host")

@host_app.command("list")
def list_hosts(...):
    # command implementation
```

### 2. Applied Fix to All Command Groups
- **Host management commands** (`host_app`)
- **Container management commands** (`container_app`) 
- **Agent management commands** (`agent_app`)

### 3. Maintained All Functionality
- All subcommands preserved with identical functionality
- Help text and command structure maintained
- Rich formatting and progress indicators retained

## Results

### ✅ CLI Now Works Properly
```bash
$ anvyl --help
# Shows main help with all commands and subcommands

$ anvyl host --help  
# Shows host management subcommands: list, add, metrics

$ anvyl container --help
# Shows container management subcommands: list, create, stop, logs, exec

$ anvyl agent --help
# Shows agent management subcommands: list, launch, stop

$ anvyl version
# Returns: Anvyl CLI v0.1.0
```

### ✅ Package Installation Works
- Successfully built new wheel and source distribution
- Package installs cleanly with `pip install`
- Entry point `anvyl` command works correctly
- All dependencies resolve properly

## Technical Details

### Typer Version Compatibility
- **Fixed for**: Typer 0.16.0+
- **Breaking Change**: Removal of `@app.group()` decorator
- **New Pattern**: Use `app.add_typer(sub_app, name="group_name")`

### Package Structure Maintained
- All existing functionality preserved
- No changes to core business logic
- CLI interface remains identical for end users
- Backward compatibility maintained at user level

## Files Modified
- `anvyl_cli.py` - Updated command group definitions
- Package rebuilt and tested successfully

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The Anvyl CLI is now fully functional with Typer 0.16.0 and can be installed and used as an installable Python package.
