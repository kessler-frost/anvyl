# LMStudio Container Support Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive LMStudio container support for MLX models in the Anvyl infrastructure orchestrator. This feature allows users to start, manage, and monitor MLX models in containerized environments using LMStudio's Python SDK.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependency Integration
- ✅ Added `lmstudio>=1.3.0` to `pyproject.toml` dependencies
- ✅ Integrated LMStudio Python SDK for model management

### 2. CLI Commands (anvyl/cli.py)
Added a complete `model` command group with the following subcommands:

#### `anvyl model list`
- Lists available and loaded MLX models
- Connects to LMStudio to fetch model information
- Supports table and JSON output formats
- Filters for MLX models specifically

#### `anvyl model start <model_id>`
- Starts user-specified MLX models in containers
- Validates MLX model format (must contain 'mlx')
- Configurable options:
  - Custom container name (`--name`)
  - Port mapping (`--port`, default: 1234)
  - Host selection (`--host-id`)
  - Memory limits (`--memory`)
- Generates safe container names automatically
- Creates containers with proper labels for identification

#### `anvyl model stop <model_id>`
- Stops model containers by model ID, container name, or container ID
- Intelligent container lookup and matching
- Graceful container shutdown

#### `anvyl model ps`
- Lists all running MLX model containers
- Shows container details including model ID, status, and host
- Supports table and JSON output formats

### 3. Enhanced gRPC Server (anvyl/grpc_server.py)
Modified the `AddContainer` method to provide special handling for LMStudio containers:

#### LMStudio Container Features
- **Automatic SDK Installation**: Containers automatically install LMStudio SDK
- **Model Loading**: Automatic MLX model loading and initialization
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoint on port 8080
- **Keep-Alive Service**: Continuous operation to serve models
- **Memory Management**: Support for Docker memory limits
- **Custom Startup Scripts**: Dynamic script generation for model initialization

#### Health Check System
- HTTP health endpoint at `localhost:8080/health`
- JSON response with model status
- Docker health check integration
- 30-second intervals with 3 retries

### 4. Container Management Integration
- Full integration with existing Anvyl container management
- Special container labels for identification:
  - `anvyl.service=lmstudio-model`
  - `anvyl.model.id=<model_id>`
  - `anvyl.model.type=mlx`
- Automatic container discovery and management

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive user guide (`LMSTUDIO_CONTAINER_SUPPORT.md`)
- ✅ Implementation summary (this document)
- ✅ Usage examples and troubleshooting guide

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Test script (`test_lmstudio_integration.py`) for validation
- Tests for CLI commands, SDK availability, and server connectivity
- Comprehensive test suite for integration validation

```

### Supported Operations
1. **Model Discovery**: List available MLX models from LMStudio
2. **Container Creation**: Start models in isolated containers
3. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and status monitoring
4. **Resource Management**: Memory limits and resource control
5. **Service Discovery**: Container labeling and identification
6. **Lifecycle Management**: Start, stop, and monitor model containers

### CLI Usage Examples
```bash
# List available MLX models
anvyl model list

# Start a model container
anvyl model start llama-3.2-1b-instruct-mlx --port 8080

# Check running model containers
anvyl model ps

# Stop a model container
anvyl model stop llama-3.2-1b-instruct-mlx
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Container Startup Process
1. Container created with Python 3.12 base image
2. LMStudio SDK automatically installed via pip
3. MLX model loaded using LMStudio API
4. Health check server started on port 8080
5. Model server exposed on port 1234 (mapped to host)
6. Keep-alive loop maintains container operation

### Error Handling
- Validation for MLX model format
- Docker availability checks
- LMStudio SDK dependency validation
- Graceful error reporting with helpful messages

### Integration Points
- **Anvyl Container Management**: Full integration with existing system
- **Host Management**: Support for multi-host deployments
- **gRPC API**: Server-side container management
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line access
